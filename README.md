# integration with @celo/contractkit

Sure, here's an example of what a README.md file for a Celo application might look like, based on the information provided in the previous examples:

## MyToken DApp

### Overview

This is a decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with the Celo blockchain and the MyToken smart contract using the Celo ContractKit and OpenZeppelin libraries. The DApp allows users to view their balance of MyToken and transfer MyToken to other addresses on the Celo network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need:

- Node.js
- Yarn
- A Celo account with some MyToken balance

### Installation

- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mytoken-dapp.git
```
- Install the dependencies:
```
cd mytoken-dapp
yarn install
```

### Set up the configuration:

- Edit the .env file to set your Celo account address and private key:
```
CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=<YOUR ACCOUNT ADDRESS HERE>
CELO_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE KEY HERE>
```
- Deploy the MyToken smart contract:
```
truffle migrate --network alfajores
```

### Usage

- Start the application:
```
yarn start
```

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

- Connect your Celo account by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button.

- View your balance of MyToken by clicking the "View Balance" button.

- Transfer MyToken to another address by entering the recipient address and amount, and clicking the "Transfer" button.

- Confirm the transaction in your Celo wallet.
